# Problem1

The Raw Data gives us information on the homicide cases in 50 large US cities. The Data gives us information on the date reported, victims name, race, age and sex. It provides us with the city, the latitude and longitude information and the disposition of the case. 

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "Unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```


```{r}
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved != "solved")
  )
```


```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

```{r}
results_df =
aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high )
```


```{r}
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

# Problem2

```{r}
data1 = read.csv("data/problem2data/con_01.csv")
```


```{r}
path_df =
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/problem2data"),
    path = str_c("data/problem2data/", files)) %>% 
      mutate(data = map(path, read_csv, col_types = "dddddddd")) %>% 
  unnest()
```

```{r}
path_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8, names_to = "week", values_to = "outcome", names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.numeric(week)
  ) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, color = files)) + geom_point() + geom_path()
```

While no major trend can be clearly seen, It can be noted that the experimental groups have a higher outcome compared to the control groups. It can also be noted that Controls 4, 5, and 6 are at the lower end while experimental groups 4, 5, and 6 are at the upper end of the chart. 


# Problem3

```{r}
sim_t_test = function(n_samp = 30, mu = 2, sigma = 5) {
 
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n_samp, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
 
  test = t.test(x ~ 1, data = sim_data)
 
  broom::tidy(test)
  
}
```

```{r}
sim_results = 
  tibble(mu = 0:6) %>% 
      mutate(
        output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(5000, sim_t_test(n = 30, mu = .x))),
        estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
               ) %>%
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest()
```

```{r}
sim_results %>% 
  mutate(
    pvalue = p.value)
```
